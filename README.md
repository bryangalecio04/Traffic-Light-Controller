# Traffic-Light-Controller
To apply our knowledge of digital logic design and programming, our fundamentals of engineering class assigned us a collaborative project to create a controller for a two-way traffic light system. Our goal was to implement a solution using digital logic hardware and, alternatively, by programming an Arduino in C++.
